# Second task is to develop a contacts list page. 

Each contact consists of 3 parts:
- User name
- Company name
- Icon with photo

Users should be divided into blocks by last name. Click on the left part of a row should “add” the user to favourites. That means the user should be marked with a star / heart icon.
