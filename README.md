# Second task is to develop a contacts list page. 

Each contact consists of 3 parts:
- User name
- Company name
- Icon with photo

Users should be divided into blocks by last name. Click on the left part of a row should “add” the user to favourites. That means the user should be marked with a star / heart icon.

# Third task
In order to work on this task you need a contact list from the task 2 implemented. Click on the user icon should redirect you to the edit profile view.

Fields that should be editable on the new view:
- User name
- Phone number
- Company name
- Bio (notes)

NOTE: The screen is an example of how the UI can look like, however, you have to follow the design from the previous task.

Data that is edited should pass general validations like:
- Phone format (+38 xxx xxx xx xx)
- Name length (max 70 symbols)

Click “back” should redirect the user back to the list of contacts. Click on save should reflect changed data on the previous screen.
